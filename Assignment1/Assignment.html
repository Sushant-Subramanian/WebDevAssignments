    <p><b>"The Doctor" was the main alias used by a mysterious renegade Time Lord from Gallifrey who travelled through time and space with various companions in their obsolete and "borrowed" TARDIS&copy &trade; , AKA, 'Time &amp Relative Dimension in Space', disguised as a 1970s police box. They were the universe's "greatest defender", having saved the cosmos thousands of times throughout a long life, becoming a great legend across the universe.</b></p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The Doctor's personal history was constantly changing and contradicting itself. According to one account, instead of a time lord, the Doctor was originally "the Timeless Child," a being from another reality, and was responsible for the creation of the race of the time lords, who got their own ability to regenerate by studying the Timeless Child's ability.</p>

    <h3>Personality/Character Traits</h3>
    <p>Despite the varying personality traits of each incarnation, the Doctor always retained "a bit of adrenaline, a dash of outrage and a hint of panic", which helped define who they were. The doctor said that his real name was not so important, and that he had specifically chosen in its place the title of "Doctor", saying that it was "like a promise you make".  The promise was, as the doctor once recited, "Never cruel or cowardly. Never give up, never give in." On one of his(/her) incarnations, the doctor claimed to be a doctor of <i>"Medicine, science, engineering, candyfloss, Lego, philosophy, people, and hope. Mostly hope."</i></p>

    <h4>Skills/Abilities</h4>
    <p>The doctor, no matter which incarnation, was meticulous, smart, brave, hopeful, knowledgeable etc. Sometimes even shown to be socially awkward, the Doctor can explore someone’s mind by putting his hands on the person’s head, and was sometimes shown to be psychic. Apparently he could also communicate with babies and spoke 5 billion languages, including animal ones. If not, the TARDIS Translation circuit always helps. Also, he had 2 hearts, 3 brain stems and 27 brains :)</p>
